# Day 1: Introduction to Engineering Sketching

## Objective
Students will learn the basics of engineering sketching and begin creating detailed 2D sketches of their chosen design from the previous lesson in their engineering notebooks.

## Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Quick sketch: Draw a simple object from three different views (front, top, and side) in your engineering notebook.

## Instruction (15 minutes)
- Introduction to engineering sketching techniques
- Overview of 2D sketching best practices, including proper dimensioning and labeling
- Importance of clear and detailed sketches in the engineering design process

## Hands-on Activity (30 minutes)
- 2D Sketching Exercise:
  1. Open your engineering notebook to a clean page
  2. Begin sketching the chosen design from the previous lesson
  3. Focus on creating accurate front and top views
  4. Use proper dimensioning and labeling techniques

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- What challenges did you face when translating your design idea into a 2D sketch? How might these challenges impact the final product?

## CA CTE Engineering Standards
- ED.2.0: Understand the processes of engineering design.
- ED.3.0: Understand measurement systems as they apply to engineering.

# Day 2: Detailed Sketching and Design Refinement

## Objective
Students will create detailed sketches of their design, including multiple views and cross-sections, and refine their design based on these visual representations.

## Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Identify three potential improvements or modifications to your initial sketch from Day 1.

## Instruction (15 minutes)
- Review of advanced sketching techniques, including cross-sections and exploded views
- Tips for adding detail and clarity to engineering sketches
- Strategies for using sketches to identify and solve design problems

## Hands-on Activity (30 minutes)
- Detailed Sketching Exercise:
  1. Create additional views of your design (e.g., side view, isometric view)
  2. Add a cross-section view to show internal components or structure
  3. Include detailed annotations and dimensions
  4. Refine the design based on insights gained from the sketching process
  5. If time allows, create an exploded view to show assembly

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- How did creating detailed sketches help you better understand and improve your design? What specific changes or refinements did you make as a result of the sketching process?

## CA CTE Engineering Standards
- ED.1.0: Understand the design process and how to solve analysis and design problems.
- ED.4.0: Understand how materials and processes are used in manufacturing.

## Day 1: Introduction to Pull-up and Pull-down Resistors

**Objective:** Students will understand the concept and purpose of pull-up and pull-down resistors in digital circuits.

**Warm-up (5 minutes):** 
- Quick quiz: What happens to an Arduino input pin when it's not connected to anything?

**Instruction (15 minutes):**
- Explain the need for defined logic states in digital circuits
- Introduce pull-up and pull-down resistor concepts
- Demonstrate simple circuit diagrams for both configurations

**Hands-on Activity (35 minutes):**
- Students build a basic circuit with an Arduino, button, and LED
- Experiment with and without pull-up/pull-down resistors
- Observe and document the behavior differences

**Reflection (5 minutes):**
- How do pull-up and pull-down resistors affect button behavior in your circuit?

## Day 2: Internal Pull-up Resistors and Button Debouncing

**Objective:** Students will learn to use Arduino's internal pull-up resistors and implement button debouncing.

**Warm-up (5 minutes):**
- Pair discussion: What issues might arise when using physical buttons in digital circuits?

**Instruction (10 minutes):**
- Explain Arduino's internal pull-up resistors and how to activate them
- Introduce the concept of button debouncing

**Hands-on Activity (40 minutes):**
- Modify previous day's circuit to use internal pull-up resistors
- Implement basic software debouncing
- Compare behavior with and without debouncing

**Reflection (5 minutes):**
- How does debouncing improve the reliability of button inputs?

## Day 3: Pull-down Resistors and State Machines

**Objective:** Students will implement pull-down resistor circuits and create a simple state machine.

**Warm-up (5 minutes):**
- Quick sketch: Draw a pull-down resistor circuit with a button and Arduino.

**Instruction (10 minutes):**
- Review pull-down resistor configuration
- Introduce the concept of state machines in programming

**Hands-on Activity (40 minutes):**
- Build a circuit with external pull-down resistors
- Create a program using a state machine to control multiple LEDs with a single button

**Reflection (5 minutes):**
- How does a state machine approach differ from simple if-else statements?

## Day 4: Introduction to Photocells

**Objective:** Students will learn about photocells and how to integrate them into Arduino projects.

**Warm-up (5 minutes):**
- Brainstorm: List potential applications for light-sensitive circuits.

**Instruction (15 minutes):**
- Explain how photocells work
- Demonstrate how to create a voltage divider with a photocell
- Show how to read analog values from a photocell

**Hands-on Activity (35 minutes):**
- Build a circuit with a photocell and LED
- Write a program to adjust LED brightness based on ambient light
- Experiment with different resistor values in the voltage divider

**Reflection (5 minutes):**
- How might you use a photocell in a real-world engineering project?

## Day 5: Integrating Buttons and Photocells

**Objective:** Students will combine their knowledge of buttons and photocells in a final project.

**Warm-up (5 minutes):**
- Quick design challenge: Sketch a circuit combining a button, photocell, and LED.

**Instruction (10 minutes):**
- Review best practices for combining multiple inputs
- Discuss strategies for managing different types of sensor data

**Hands-on Activity (40 minutes):**
- Create a project that uses both a button and a photocell
- Example: Light-activated alarm system with manual override
- Students design, build, and program their circuits

**Reflection (5 minutes):**
- What was the most challenging aspect of combining different types of inputs in your project?

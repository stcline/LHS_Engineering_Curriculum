# Creating and Using a Decision Matrix

## Objective
Students will learn to create and utilize a decision matrix to evaluate design alternatives objectively.

## Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Quick think: List three factors you would consider when choosing a new smartphone.

## Instruction (15 minutes)
- Introduction to decision matrices in engineering design
- Explain the components of a decision matrix:
  1. Design alternatives
  2. Evaluation criteria
  3. Weighting factors
  4. Scoring system

## Hands-on Activity (30 minutes)
- Decision Matrix Challenge:
  - Students will create a decision matrix for selecting the best design for a water bottle
  - Steps:
    1. Define 3-4 design alternatives (e.g., plastic, metal, glass, collapsible)
    2. Identify 5-6 evaluation criteria (e.g., durability, cost, weight, eco-friendliness)
    3. Assign weighting factors to criteria (1-5 scale)
    4. Score each alternative against the criteria (1-5 scale)
    5. Calculate weighted scores and determine the best option
  - Students will work in pairs to create their matrices and compare results

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- How did using a decision matrix influence your design choice? What are the benefits and potential limitations of this tool in the engineering design process?

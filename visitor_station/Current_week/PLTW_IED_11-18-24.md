# Introduction to the Design Process

## Objective
Students will understand and apply the basic steps of the engineering design process through a hands-on activity.

## Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Quick brainstorm: List three everyday objects that you think could be improved through redesign.

## Instruction (15 minutes)
- Brief overview of the engineering design process steps:
  1. Define the problem
  2. Research
  3. Brainstorm solutions
  4. Select best solution
  5. Build a prototype
  6. Test and evaluate
  7. Improve and redesign

## Hands-on Activity (30 minutes)
- Paper Airplane Challenge:
  - Students will design, build, and test a paper airplane to achieve maximum flight distance.
  - Apply the design process steps:
    1. Define: Create an airplane that flies the farthest
    2. Research: Briefly explore basic aerodynamics principles
    3. Brainstorm: Sketch 2-3 design ideas
    4. Select: Choose the most promising design
    5. Build: Construct the paper airplane
    6. Test: Conduct flight tests and measure distances
    7. Improve: Make adjustments based on test results

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- How did following the design process help you create a better paper airplane? Which step did you find most crucial for success?

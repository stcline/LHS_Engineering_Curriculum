## Tuesday: Robotic Inputs and Outputs (Continued)

- **Objective**: Apply knowledge of robotic inputs and outputs through practical applications (Bloom's Level: Apply)
- **Warm-up**: Review key concepts from previous day's lesson on robotics.
- **Instruction**:
  - *Lecture*: Practical applications of robotic inputs and outputs.
  - *Hands-on Activity*: Program a more complex task using robotic inputs and outputs.
- **Activity**: Refine previous programs to include more sophisticated input/output controls.
- **Reflection Question**: What improvements did you make to your robotic program today?
- **Standards Addressed**: CTE.MPD.C.C3.1: Understand manufacturing processes including automation technologies.

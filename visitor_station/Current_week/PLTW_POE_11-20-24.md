# Wednesday: Refinement and Testing

## Objective
Students will refine their car designs based on test results and prepare for the competition.

## Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Brainstorm three ways to increase traction for your car.

## Instruction (5 minutes)
- Discussion on the importance of iterative testing in engineering
- Review of common issues and potential solutions

## Hands-on Activity (45 minutes)
- Students continue refining and testing their cars
- Document at least ten iterations in their engineering notebooks

## Reflection (5 minutes)
- What was the most significant improvement you made to your car design today, and why?

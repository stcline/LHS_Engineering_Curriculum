# Creating an Effective Problem Statement

## Objective
Students will learn to craft clear and concise problem statements for engineering design projects.

## Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Quick brainstorm: List three everyday objects or situations that could be improved through engineering design.

## Instruction (15 minutes)
- Brief overview of the importance of problem statements in engineering design
- Introduce the 3W framework for problem statements:
  1. What is the problem or need?
  2. Who has the problem or need?
  3. Why is it important to solve?

## Hands-on Activity (30 minutes)
- Problem Statement Challenge:
  - Students will create problem statements for common scenarios
  - Apply the 3W framework:
    1. Identify a problem from the warm-up brainstorm
    2. Define who is affected by the problem
    3. Explain why solving the problem is important
    4. Write a concise problem statement using the format:
       "[Who] needs [what] because [why]."
  - Share and critique problem statements in small groups

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- What was the most challenging aspect of creating a problem statement? How might a well-defined problem statement guide the engineering design process?

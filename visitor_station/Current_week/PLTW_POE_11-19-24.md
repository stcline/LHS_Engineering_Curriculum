# Tuesday: Building and Initial Testing

## Objective
Students will construct their tug-of-war cars based on their CAD designs and conduct initial tests.

## Warm-up (10 minutes)
- Calculate the gear ratio for a simple gear train using 24T and 60T gears.

## Instruction (15 minutes)
- Discussion on translating CAD designs to physical models
- Safety briefing for using tools and equipment

## Hands-on Activity (65 minutes)
- Students begin building their cars using provided materials
- Conduct initial tests and make necessary adjustments

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- How did the physical construction process differ from your CAD design? What changes did you need to make?

## CA CTE Engineering Standards
- ED.3.0: Understand measurement systems as they apply to engineering.
- ED.4.0: Understand how materials and processes are used in manufacturing.

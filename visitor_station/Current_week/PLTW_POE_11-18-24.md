# Monday, 11/18: CAD Design Day

## Objective
Students will create a detailed CAD design of their tug-of-war car using Onshape.

## Warm-up (10 minutes)
- Quick sketch challenge: Draw a basic car design that you think would be effective in a tug-of-war competition.

## Instruction (20 minutes)
- Brief discussion on the importance of CAD in engineering design
- Review of Onshape basics and tips for efficient modeling

## Hands-on Activity (60 minutes)
- Students work on their CAD designs in Onshape
- Teacher circulates to provide guidance and answer questions

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- What was the most challenging aspect of creating your CAD design, and how did you overcome it?

## CA CTE Engineering Standards
- ED.1.0: Understand the design process and how to solve analysis and design problems.
- ED.2.0: Understand the processes of engineering design.

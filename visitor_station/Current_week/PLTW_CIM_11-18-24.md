# Day 1: Introduction to Digital Sensors

## Objective
Students will learn to use digital sensors (button and limit switch) with the VEX V5 system.

## Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Quick brainstorm: List three real-world applications of digital sensors.

## Instruction (15 minutes)
- Introduction to digital sensors and their applications in robotics
- Overview of VEX V5 Brain and its digital ports
- Explanation of how to connect and program digital sensors

## Hands-on Activity (30 minutes)
- Digital Sensor Challenge:
  1. Connect a button and a limit switch to the VEX V5 Brain
  2. Write a program that:
     - Turns on an LED when the button is pressed
     - Prints "Limit reached" on the Brain's screen when the limit switch is activated
  3. Test and debug the program

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- What are the key differences between using a button and a limit switch? How might these differences affect their use in robot design?

## CA CTE Engineering Standards
- ED.2.0: Understand the processes of engineering design.
- ED.7.0: Understand the fundamentals of control systems and how they apply to robotics and automation.

# Day 2: Introduction to Analog Sensors

## Objective
Students will learn to use analog sensors (potentiometer and distance sensor) with the VEX V5 system.

## Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Quick sketch: Draw a simple graph showing the difference between digital and analog signals.

## Instruction (15 minutes)
- Introduction to analog sensors and their applications in robotics
- Overview of VEX V5 Brain's analog ports
- Explanation of how to connect and program analog sensors

## Hands-on Activity (30 minutes)
- Analog Sensor Challenge:
  1. Connect a potentiometer and a distance sensor to the VEX V5 Brain
  2. Write a program that:
     - Displays the potentiometer's value (0-100%) on the Brain's screen
     - Prints the distance measured by the sensor in inches
  3. Test and calibrate the sensors

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- How does the continuous range of values provided by analog sensors enhance robot functionality compared to digital sensors?

## CA CTE Engineering Standards
- ED.3.0: Understand measurement systems as they apply to engineering.
- ED.6.0: Understand prediction analysis and verification of engineering designs.

# Day 3: Advanced Sensor Integration

## Objective
Students will combine digital and analog sensors, including the optical sensor, in a more complex program.

## Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Identify three potential uses for an optical sensor in a robot design.

## Instruction (15 minutes)
- Review of digital and analog sensor programming
- Introduction to the optical sensor and its capabilities
- Strategies for integrating multiple sensors in a single program

## Hands-on Activity (30 minutes)
- Multi-Sensor Integration Challenge:
  1. Connect all available sensors (button, limit switch, potentiometer, distance sensor, and optical sensor) to the VEX V5 Brain
  2. Write a program that:
     - Uses the button to start/stop the program
     - Uses the limit switch to reverse a motor's direction
     - Uses the potentiometer to control a motor's speed
     - Uses the distance sensor to stop a motor when an object is within 6 inches
     - Uses the optical sensor to detect and display the color of an object
  3. Test and refine the program

## Reflection (10 minutes)
- How might combining multiple sensors enhance a robot's ability to interact with its environment? What challenges did you face in integrating multiple sensors?

## CA CTE Engineering Standards
- ED.1.0: Understand the design process and how to solve analysis and design problems.
- ED.8.0: Understand the fundamentals of systems engineering.

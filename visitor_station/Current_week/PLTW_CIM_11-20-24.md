## Day 1: Digital Sensors and GitHub Introduction

**Objective:** Students will create Python scripts for digital sensors and learn GitHub basics.

**Warm-up (5 minutes):** 
- Quick review: What are the key differences between digital and analog sensors?

**Instruction (15 minutes):**
- Review of Python syntax for VEX V5 programming
- Introduction to GitHub and its role in code submission
- Demonstration of creating and committing files on GitHub

**Hands-on Activity (35 minutes):**
- Students create and test button_LED.py and limit_LED.py scripts
- Set up GitHub accounts and clone the assignment repository
- Commit and push the completed scripts to GitHub

**Reflection (5 minutes):**
- What challenges did you face in implementing the digital sensor scripts?

## Day 2: Analog and Advanced Sensors

**Objective:** Students will work with analog and more complex sensors.

**Warm-up (5 minutes):**
- Pair discussion: How might a potentiometer be used in robotics applications?

**Instruction (10 minutes):**
- Overview of analog sensor programming techniques
- Introduction to distance and optical sensor functionality

**Hands-on Activity (40 minutes):**
- Create and test pot_LED.py script
- Develop distance_LED.py script
- Begin work on optical_LED.py script
- Commit and push completed scripts to GitHub

**Reflection (5 minutes):**
- How does programming for analog sensors differ from digital sensors?

## Day 3: Project Finalization and Code Quality

**Objective:** Students will complete their sensor integration project and focus on code quality.

**Warm-up (5 minutes):**
- Quick quiz: Name three best practices for writing clean, readable code.

**Instruction (10 minutes):**
- Review of code commenting best practices
- Tips for meaningful variable naming
- Final instructions on GitHub submission process

**Hands-on Activity (40 minutes):**
- Complete optical_LED.py script
- Review and refine all scripts for code quality and commenting
- Final testing of all scripts
- Ensure all scripts are correctly committed and pushed to GitHub

**Reflection (5 minutes):**
- What was the most valuable skill you learned during this project?

This lesson plan is tailored to the specific requirements of the Sensor and Actuator Integration Processes assignment, focusing on creating the required Python scripts and using GitHub for submission. It's designed to fit within three one-hour class periods, balancing instruction, hands-on coding, and reflection time.

### Lesson Plan for Introduction to Engineering Class

Week of: 8-26-2024

#### Monday: Introduction to the Engineering Design Process

- **Warm-up (5 minutes):** Quick brainstorming session on what students think engineering is.
- **I Do (15 minutes):** Present an overview of the engineering design process, highlighting key stages such as defining the problem, brainstorming, designing, building, testing, and improving.
- **We Do (25 minutes):** As a class, work through a simple problem using the design process, such as designing a paper airplane that can fly the farthest.
- **You Do (15 minutes):** Students begin working in pairs to design something that can launch a small projectile the furthest using simple materials.

#### Tuesday: Deep Dive into the Design Process

- **Warm-up (5 minutes):** Reflect on a famous engineering feat and discuss what design process might have been used.
- **I Do (10 minutes):** Discuss how to brainstorm effectively and generate multiple solutions to a problem.
- **We Do (20 minutes):** In small groups, students brainstorm solutions for the "catapult" problem they defined on Monday.
- **You Do (20 minutes):** Students select one solution from their brainstorming session and start sketching their design.

#### Wednesday: Prototyping and Testing (50-minute class)

- **Warm-up (5 minutes):** Quick discussion on the importance of prototyping in engineering.
- **I Do (10 minutes):** Demonstrate how to create a simple prototype using basic materials.
- **We Do (15 minutes):** In groups, students start building a prototype of their design.
- **You Do (20 minutes):** Students continue working on their prototypes and prepare for testing.

#### Thursday: Testing and Iteration

- **Warm-up (5 minutes):** Share a short video or story about a famous engineering failure and its subsequent redesign.
- **I Do (10 minutes):** Explain how to test a prototype and gather data for improvements.
- **We Do (20 minutes):** Conduct a class-wide testing session where each group tests their prototype and records results.
- **You Do (25 minutes):** Students analyze their test results and identify areas for improvement in their designs.

#### Friday: Presentation and Reflection

- **Warm-up (5 minutes):** Quick reflection on what students learned about the design process.
- **I Do (10 minutes):** Provide tips on how to present engineering projects effectively.
- **We Do (15 minutes):** In pairs, students practice presenting their projects to each other.
- **You Do (30 minutes):** Each group presents their project to the class, explaining their design process, challenges faced, and how they overcame them.

This lesson plan aims to engage students actively in the engineering design process while fostering collaboration and critical thinking skills.

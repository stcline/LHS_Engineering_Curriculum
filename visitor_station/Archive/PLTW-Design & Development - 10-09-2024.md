## Thursday: Alternative Energy Car - Fuel Cells

- **Objective**: Analyze the use of fuel cells as an alternative energy source for vehicles (Bloom's Level: Analyze)
- **Warm-up**: Discuss how fuel cells work and their potential benefits over traditional combustion engines.
- **Instruction**:
  - *Lecture*: Overview of fuel cell technology used in vehicles.
  - *Hands-on Activity*: Experiment with fuel cell-powered car models, comparing performance with solar-powered models from previous lessons.
- **Activity**: Lab activity: Test different types of fuel cells to determine which provides the best performance for car models under various conditions.
- **Reflection Question**: What are the trade-offs between using fuel cells versus other alternative energy sources like solar panels or batteries?
- **CA CTE Standards**: CTE.EC.A.A1.1: Understand renewable energy systems and their applications in engineering contexts.

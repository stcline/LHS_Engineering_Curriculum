### **Course Overview**

The Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) course is part of the Project Lead The Way (PLTW) Engineering program. It provides students with an understanding of the manufacturing industry, focusing on transforming ideas into products through processes such as product design, robotics, and automation. Students will enhance their knowledge and skills in Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) to produce products using a Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) mill. The course culminates in a capstone project where students design, build, and program a manufacturing system model.

### **Course Units**

1. **Principles of Manufacturing (18%)**
   - Explore the history and evolution of manufacturing systems.
   - Understand how manufacturing components are interconnected.
   - Learn to use input and output devices to model manufacturing processes.
   - Integrate financial considerations into manufacturing design.

2. **Manufacturing Processes (30%)**
   - Analyze and improve product designs for manufacturability.
   - Develop machine language (G&M code) for CNC devices.
   - Create physical parts using FDM printers including material selection and settings.
   - Operate a CNC mill to create a physical part from a digital design.

3. **Elements of Automation (26%)**
   - Introduction to robotic automation within manufacturing systems.
   - Develop programs for robotic arms and integrate them into complex systems.
   - Apply power concepts related to robotic automation.

4. **Integration of Manufacturing Elements (26%)**
   - Apply course concepts to a capstone project.
   - Design, build, and program a flexible manufacturing system model.
   - Explore career opportunities in the manufacturing industry.

### **Course Objectives**

- Develop proficiency in CAD and CAM software for product design and manufacturing.
- Apply the engineering design process to solve manufacturing challenges.
- Collaborate effectively in teams to design and prototype manufacturing systems.
- Understand and apply principles of automation and robotics in manufacturing.
- Communicate design solutions through presentations and technical documentation.

### **Tools and Software**

- CAD modeling software
- CAM software for 3D milling
- CNC milling machine
- Shop tools and hand tools
- Manufacturing and robot design systems
- Programming languages for automation

### **Professional Skills Development**

- Team collaboration and project management
- Problem-solving and critical thinking
- Communication and presentation skills
- Technical writing and ethical reasoning

### **Policies**

**Late Work Policy:**  
Assignments missed due to excused or unexcused absences can be completed without penalty within ten school days of the student's return. If the absence occurs within ten days of the semester's end, students have until the last day of the semester to submit work. Late work due to reasons other than absence will be accepted until the end of the current quarter. All accepted late work will receive a 50% penalty.

**Cell Phone Policy:**  
All cell phones must be stored at the front of the classroom in the designated phone caddy unless prior arrangements have been made with the teacher. Phones may be retrieved with one minute remaining in class.

**Safety Policy:**  
Students must pass a safety test before using any lab equipment.

### **Assessment and Grading**

**Grading Scale:**
- **A - 90-100%**
- **B - 80-89.99%**
- **C - 70-79.99%**
- **D - 60-69.99%**
- **F - below 60%**

**Grading Categories:**
- **Projects and Assignments:** 50%
- **Quizzes and Tests:** 30%
- **Participation and Collaboration:** 20%

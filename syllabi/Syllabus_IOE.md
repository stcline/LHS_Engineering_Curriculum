### **Course Overview**

The Introduction to Engineering Design (IED) course is part of the Project Lead The Way (PLTW) Engineering Program. It introduces students to the engineering design process, emphasizing the application of math, science, and engineering standards to solve real-world problems. Students will work both individually and in teams to develop and document design solutions using engineering notebooks and 3D modeling software.

### **Course Units**

1. **Design and Problem Solving**
   - Introduction to the engineering design process
   - Technical sketching and 3D solid modeling
   - Prototyping and statistical analysis

2. **Assembly Design**
   - Reverse engineering and multi-component systems
   - Material selection and manufacturability
   - CAD assembly modeling and documentation

3. **Thoughtful Product Design**
   - Human-centered design and sustainability
   - Systems thinking and ethical implications
   - Generative design and product life-cycle analysis

4. **Making Things Move**
   - Mechanical and electrical systems
   - Motion control and electromechanical solutions
   - Advanced CAD skills for design and documentation

### **Course Objectives**

- Develop proficiency in 3D CAD modeling and technical drawing.
- Apply the engineering design process to solve complex problems.
- Collaborate effectively in teams to design and prototype solutions.
- Understand and apply principles of sustainability and ethical design.
- Communicate design solutions through presentations and technical documentation.

### **Tools and Software**

- Autodesk Fusion 360 or similar 3D solid modeling software
- Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint)
- Dial calipers and 3D prototyping equipment

### **Professional Skills Development**

- Team collaboration and project management
- Problem-solving and critical thinking
- Communication and presentation skills
- Technical writing and ethical practice

### **Policies**

**Late Work Policy:**  
Assignments missed due to excused or unexcused absences can be completed without penalty within ten school days of the student's return. If the absence occurs within ten days of the semester's end, students have until the last day of the semester to submit work. Late work due to reasons other than absence will be accepted until the end of the current quarter.

**Cell Phone Policy:**  
All cell phones must be stored at the front of the classroom in the designated phone caddy unless prior arrangements have been made with the teacher. Phones may be retrieved with one minute remaining in class.

**Safety Policy:**  
Students must pass a safety test before using any lab equipment.

### **Assessment and Grading**

**Grading Scale:**
- **A - 90-100%**
- **B - 80-89.99%**
- **C - 70-79.99%**
- **D - 60-69.99%**
- **F - below 60%**

**Grading Categories:**
- **Projects and Assignments:** 50%
- **Quizzes and Tests:** 30%
- **Participation and Collaboration:** 20%

### **Course Overview**

The Principles of Engineering (POE) course is a comprehensive introduction to various engineering fields, including product design, robotics, mechanical design, infrastructure, and sustainability. Students will explore engineering principles and cutting-edge tools such as robotics, 3D modeling, programming, and prototyping. This course is designed for high school students in grades 9-12 and aims to develop technical skills through hands-on projects and problem-solving activities.

### **Course Units**

1. **Introduction to Product Design and Development**
   - Engineering design process and collaborative modeling
   - Material selection and testing
   - Designing and prototyping

2. **Mechanical Design**
   - Simple and compound machines
   - Mechanisms and motion conversion
   - Solving real-world problems

3. **Application of Robotics**
   - Introduction to robotics and programming
   - Robotics in action and artificial intelligence
   - Designing and building robotic systems

4. **Energy in Action**
   - Electrical circuits and fluid power
   - Kinematics and energy applications
   - Integration of circuits, fluid power, and kinematics

5. **Designing Infrastructure and Developing Sustainability**
   - Statics and renewable energy
   - Transportation design and infrastructure redesign
   - Sustainable practices and environmental impact

### **Course Objectives**

- Apply the engineering design process to solve complex problems.
- Develop proficiency in 3D modeling, programming, and robotics.
- Collaborate effectively in teams to design and prototype solutions.
- Understand and apply principles of sustainability and ethical design.
- Communicate design solutions through presentations and technical documentation.

### **Tools and Software**

- 3D modeling software (e.g., Autodesk Fusion 360)
- Programming software and robotics hardware
- Prototyping equipment and engineering tools

### **Professional Skills Development**

- Team collaboration and project management
- Problem-solving and critical thinking
- Communication and presentation skills
- Technical writing and ethical reasoning

### **Policies**

**Late Work Policy:**  
Assignments missed due to excused or unexcused absences can be completed without penalty within ten school days of the student's return. If the absence occurs within ten days of the semester's end, students have until the last day of the semester to submit work. Late work due to reasons other than absence will be accepted until the end of the current quarter. All accepted late work will receive a 50% penalty.

**Cell Phone Policy:**  
All cell phones must be stored at the front of the classroom in the designated phone caddy unless prior arrangements have been made with the teacher. Phones may be retrieved with one minute remaining in class.

**Safety Policy:**  
Students must pass a safety test before using any lab equipment.

### **Assessment and Grading**

**Grading Scale:**
- **A - 90-100%**
- **B - 80-89.99%**
- **C - 70-79.99%**
- **D - 60-69.99%**
- **F - below 60%**

**Grading Categories:**
- **Projects and Assignments:** 50%
- **Quizzes and Tests:** 30%
- **Participation and Collaboration:** 20%
